# PKM
Mirror for official PKM database and programs
## What is it?
PKM is a package manager for one of my other projects: [Pythinux](https://github.com/WinFan3672/Pythinux). This repo contains a copy of all of the programs in PKM's official repo.

## Why use this mirror?
* 000webost is really slow and GitHub is faster
* 000webhost is often blocked by organisations, but not GitHub.

## Adding mirror to PKM
In pythinux's console, type the following command:
```
echo command coming soon :)
```

And it will be added.
As a bonus, type:
```
pkm db remove https://winfan3672.000webhostapp.com/pkm/beta.pkm
```
And this one will be used exclusively for PKM's needs.
To finalise changes, type: ```pkm db save```. It will save your changes so that they persist after the OS shuts down.
